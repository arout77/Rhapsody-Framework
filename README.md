Rhapsody
==========
Rhapsody is a lightweight web development framework built for PHP 8 and offers extreme performance, a modular architecture, elegant syntax and an easy to use philosophy.

### PROJECT STATUS
Rhapsody has just released version 1.0.0, and is now ready for production use. 
There are still more features to be added, you will receive a notification when updates are available (you'll need to consent to receive alerts during/after install).

### PHILOSOPHY & GOALS
Like all frameworks, Rhapsody strives to simplify and speed up the web development process. Where Rhapsody deviates from most frameworks is in its emphasis on the *developer*, by creating an extraordinarily easy to learn and easy to use environment -- without sacrificing performance,
features or extensibility. A framework should help a developer by completing common tasks for the developer and providing options for other tasks, but still being perfectly capable of "getting out of the way" when needed. A framework cannot be all things to all people, so it is important to be
able to *safely* work outside the box with minimal fuss when needed.
We think that you'll find the blazing fast performance, the ultra-light footprint, the comprehensive feature set and the emphasis on ease of use 
to be an indispensable new tool in your web development repertoire.
