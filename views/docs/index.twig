    <h1>Welcome to the Rhapsody Framework</h1>
    <p>
        Rhapsody is a lightweight, modern PHP framework designed for building elegant and maintainable web applications.
        It follows a familiar MVC-like architecture and provides a solid foundation with powerful features like a flexible router,
        a secure authentication system, a robust validation engine, and an efficient templating system powered by Twig.
    </p>
    <p>
        This documentation will guide you through the installation, configuration, and core concepts of the framework.
        Use the navigation on the left to explore the different components and learn how to build your first application with Rhapsody.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of Rhapsody is to provide a simple yet powerful starting point. It handles the boilerplate and provides
        essential tools without imposing a rigid structure, giving you the freedom to build your application your way.
        We believe in clean code, modern PHP features, and a great developer experience.
