              Rhapsody Framework uses the Twig template engine to display view files. For simplicity 
              and future compatibility, the framework simply provides a wrapper in which to pass data to 
              Twig; no functionality or syntax in Twig itself has been changed. If you are new to Twig, 
              it is highly recommended to go over some of the <a href="https://twig.symfony.com" target="_blank">Twig documentation</a>. 
              Twig is very powerful, but also very simple to get started in, especially if you have used a PHP 
              template engine in the past, such as Blade or Smarty. At the minimum, you'll want to know about 
              blocks, template inheritance, creating and displaying variables and looping in Twig. 
              The syntax for getting the value of the settings is as follows: 
              <p>
                <code>$this->config->setting('')</code>
              </p>
              <p>In the above example, we would pass the label of the option listed in the .env file, in the 
                form of a string.</p>
              <p>Lets take a look at an example of how we can get the website name and 
                pass it to the Twig view file.</p>
